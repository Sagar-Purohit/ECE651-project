# ECE651-project

As technology is evolving day by day everything is moving towards artificial intelligence. The automobile industry is also moving in the same directions to get better results in increasing the customer comfort, decreasing the human errors and achieving the better efficiency. The automobile industry is investing in designing the autonomous cars which drives without human interactions. In this project we are thinking about learning different machine learning concepts used to design such a car, and for this we are going to take one course on online e-learning website udemy academy and follow the machine learning concepts such as deep learning and reinforcement learning taught there to design such a project. In addition to this we will use the concepts taught in the class to implement the project simulation. As our main goal is to learn, we are going to implement the same project that is developed in the course of udemy academy.
